# 🚂 Deck & Diesel

*A terminal-based ASCII visual novel about strangers, stories, and steampunk blackjack.*

**Deck & Diesel** puts you aboard the Ironclad Express — a legendary train rumbling through a smog-drenched, brass-and-cog steampunk Europe. In this narrative-driven experience, you'll talk with strange passengers, play hands of blackjack, and uncover secrets as the rails carry you toward your destination — or destiny.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Deck & Diesel is a hybrid of:

* **Visual novel storytelling** – Meet new passengers each journey and shape the story through branching dialogue
* **Blackjack encounters** – Play hands of cards with other passengers to win items, trust, or critical information
* **Steampunk worldbuilding** – Dive into a world of diesel fumes, automaton bartenders, lost technologies, and elegant, smoky intrigue
* **ASCII art terminal UI** – All graphics rendered in stylized text with immersive atmosphere and minimalist design

Every trip is a new story. Every player choice adds depth to the world — and every blackjack hand can change everything.
