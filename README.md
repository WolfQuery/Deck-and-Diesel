# ðŸš‚ Deck & Diesel

_A terminal-based ASCII deckbuilding tycoon game._

Build a rail empire across a growing ASCII map by drawing and playing cards to lay tracks, deliver cargo, expand your deck, and outsmart random events. Designed for both learning and fun, **Steam & Steel** blends strategy, planning, and the satisfying grind of progress â€” one card at a time.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

Steam & Steel is a hybrid of:
- **Deckbuilding mechanics** â€“ Build your custom deck from track, train, cargo, and upgrade cards
- **Rail tycoon gameplay** â€“ Strategically expand across cities, deliver goods, and optimize profit
- **ASCII charm** â€“ Everything rendered directly in your terminal using stylized ASCII art

You start with a basic deck and a small amount of money. With each turn, draw a hand of cards and choose how to expand your empire â€” laying track, placing trains, upgrading systems, and delivering cargo for income. As you grow, you'll unlock new cities and access more powerful cards.

## ðŸ§© Key Mechanics

### ðŸ”¹ Cards
- `TrackCard`: Lay connections between cities
- `TrainCard`: Add or move trains on your routes
- `UpgradeCard`: Boost train stats, cargo values, or income
- `EventCard`: Deal with turn-based surprises like storms, repairs, or gold rushes

Each card has its own ASCII art, cost, and effect, giving you strategic choices in every turn.

### ðŸ”¹ ASCII Map
Rendered using terminal graphics, the map evolves as you lay track between cities and create routes. Cities offer unique goods and challenges, encouraging smart pathing.


### ðŸ”¹ Gameplay Loop
1. **Draw** a hand of 5 cards
2. **Play** cards to build, move, deliver, or upgrade
3. **Resolve** events or random encounters
4. **Earn** money based on cargo delivery
5. **Purchase** new cards or upgrades

Your goal is to reach the West Coast with a profitable empire before the turn limit runs out â€” or your economy collapses.
